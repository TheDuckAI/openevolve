    Args:
      decomposition: a tuple of 3 factor matrices with the same number of columns.
        (The number of columns specifies the rank of the decomposition.) To
        construct a tensor, we take the outer product of the i-th column of the
        three factor matrices, for 1 <= i <= rank, and add up all these outer
        products.
      n: the first parameter of the matrix multiplication tensor.
      m: the second parameter of the matrix multiplication tensor.
      p: the third parameter of the matrix multiplication tensor.
      rank: the expected rank of the decomposition.
